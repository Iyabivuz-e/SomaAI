Rwanda's Vision 2050
Rwanda has set a new long-term development strategy, Vision 2050, which aims to transform the country into an upper-middle-income country by 2035 and a high-income country by 2050. This vision focuses on high quality of life and standards of living for all Rwandans.

Key pillars include:
1. Human Development: Ensuring universal access to quality health care, education, and technology.
2. Economic Competitiveness: Building a knowledge-based economy with modern infrastructure.
3. Agriculture: Transforming subsistence farming into commercial, modern agriculture.

The curriculum for S1 Geography covers these economic developments to help students understand national goals.
